# Test_Python

Here is a collection about all the Python coding problems that I met so far.

For each question, I will give a description of the problem and the code I used. 

I'm still studying coding with Ptyhon and I'm not a professionel programmer. 

Therefore, if you have any suggest or improvement about the code, please let me know. 

This is a good opportunity to share knowledge
